# Portfolio-Site-2022
My new hand made portfolio website that I've created using the markdown languages and the bootstrap framework

## Work in progress

This website is still under construction, I have ICT -engineering studies to focus on primarily so this project will be my side project for the time being

You can see the site's current status at this link:
